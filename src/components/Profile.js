      <p>
        My journey in Computer Science began with a challenging stint at the University of Cape Town — I did not graduate. However, by God’s grace, I got a Software Engineering scholarship from ALX.

        My core interest revolves around researching both established and emerging technologies through extensive research papers. I am driven to tackle significant challenges by delivering optimal solutions founded on robust principles.

        When I’m not immersed in tech, I indulge in video games, soccer practice, skateboarding, occasional modeling, and making music. But my real passion is networking—I’m almost always at events, expanding my professional circle. 60% of the time, it works every time.
